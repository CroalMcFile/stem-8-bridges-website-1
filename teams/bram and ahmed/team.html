        in this bridge building 
        competition we are trying 
        to make a bridge that can hold
        the most weight and weigh the 
        least we can only make these
        bridges out of spegetti and 
        hot glue, we are given 250 
        sticks of spagetti and 5 hot
        glue sticks our bridge must be
        less than 20 cm high 10 cm 
        wide and 60 cm long .

        we are using the truss bridge design for our project we then test it by putting it in a press to see how mutch weight it can hold.

        our bridge supprted a total of 3 pounds we think that the faliure was due to the support atthe corners where the bridge is under the most pressure also not all corners could reach the egdes of the ravine so we assume this was a factor.
