<img src="image.png">  
<p>When we started building our first bridge, we took a careful approach to our design process. We aimed to find the most straightforward and basic design available that could still support some weight. After exploring different options, we settled on a Pratt truss design. When tested, Our bridge was much too heavy and large because we layered the spaghetti with 5 pieces for each column. We should have figured out how much spaghetti we needed instead of using all of our materials for the sake of it. Because of our design errors, the bridge received a mediocre score of around 16.
