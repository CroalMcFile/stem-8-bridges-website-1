<h1>Design process for bridge 1</h1>

<p>For the first bridge we built, we mostly dived in with no expectations or experience and just mostly followed the suggestions by Mr.Hengeveld. It mostly consisted of making a template of our bridge design and matching the spaghetti to our drawing to make the bridge. </p>

<p>For the second bridge, we started to take into account about why our first bridge failed and trying to improve on those things on the second one. So we made each of our Spaghetti bars 5 strands thick instead of 2, and we made sure all the angles were even to that the bridge wouldn't be slanted to curved at the end.
